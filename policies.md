"We are a schedule-ahead service and riders can (1) call once we open to schedule a ride with a dispatcher or (2) leave a voicemail on the day of their ride request. We do not call riders ahead of time to confirm due to capacity constraints, but riders are always welcome to call us to double-check that their ride was scheduled. We are a feminist, 'for-the-students/by-the-students' organization and operate out of the Women's Center in EMU 12F."


## Academic integrity

All students will be expected to adhere to the University's guidelines on academic integrity as outlined in the Student Conduct Code: https://policies.uoregon.edu/vol-3-administration-student-affairs/ch-1-conduct/student-conduct-code. Academic misconduct includes cheating ("any act of deception by which a student misrepresents or misleadingly demonstrates that the student has mastered information on an academic exercise that the student has not mastered"), and plagiarism ("using the ideas or writings of another as one's own"). We have a zero tolerance policy for academic dishonesty. All persons involved in academic dishonesty will be disciplined in accordance with University regulations and procedures. 

## Discrimination and Harassment

**Prohibited Discrimination and Harassment:**
Any student who has experienced sexual assault, relationship violence, sex or gender-based bullying, stalking, and/or sexual harassment may seek resources and help at safe.uoregon.edu. To get help by phone, a student can also call either the UO's 24-hour hotline at 541-346-7244 (SAFE), or the non-confidential Title IX Coordinator at 541-346-8136. From the SAFE website, students may also connect to Callisto, a confidential, third-party reporting site that is not a part of the university.

Students experiencing any other form of discrimination or harassment can find information at respect.uoregon.edu or aaeo.uoregon.edu or contact the non-confidential AAEO office at 541-346-3123 or the Dean of Students Office at 541-346-3216 for help. As UO policy has different reporting requirements based on the nature of the reported harassment or discrimination, additional information about reporting requirements for discrimination or harassment unrelated to sexual assault, relationship violence, sex or gender based bullying, stalking, and/or sexual harassment is available at Discrimination & Harassment.

**Reporting:**
The instructor of this class is a Student-Directed Employee.
If you disclose discriminiation or harassment to me, I will respond to you with respect and kindness. 
I will listen to you, and will be sensitive to your needs and requests. I will not judge you. I will support you. 
I will only report the information shared to the university administration when you as the student requests that the information be reported (unless someone is in imminent risk of serious harm or is a minor). Please note the difference between 'privacy' and 'confidentiality.' As a Student-Directed Employee I can offer privacy because I am not required to report certain information to the university. However, I cannot be bound by confidentiality in the same way that a counselor or attorney is. Confidential resources such as these means that information shared is protected by federal and state laws. Any information that I as a student-directed employee receive may still be accessed by university or court proceedings. This means, for example, that I could still be called as a witness or required to turn over any related documents or notes that I keep. 

Please note also that I am required to report all other forms of prohibited discrimination or harassment to the university administration. Specific details about confidentiality of information and reporting obligations of employees can be found at titleix.uoregon.edu.

UO employees, including faculty, staff, and GEs, are mandatory reporters of child abuse (pertaining to individuals under age 18). This statement is to advise you that your disclosure of information about child abuse to the instructor may trigger a legal duty to report that information to the designated authorities.
